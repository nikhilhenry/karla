git clone https://github.com/trishitdedhia/karla.git /usr/local/
```

## Official Packages
The following is a list of the official packages that Karla can learn:

> ### Creator's Note
> Karla started as a culmination project (my own initiative - not official) for the 'Coding Cafe' course in the first semester of my freshman year at Plaksha University. The course was primarily directed towards the introduction of computers, shell scripting and python.
>
> Karla is a bash-based package manager that handles and runs image processing functions that are primarily built on python. For multi-fuctionality and customisation, I've given the user the ability to teach Karla their own custom fuction by tapping a git repository.
